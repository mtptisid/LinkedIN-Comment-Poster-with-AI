This chatbot leverages the power of RetrieverAugmented Generation RAG to answer user questions based on uploaded PDF documents. Check it out here httpslnkd.ind9KMgznt How it Works Upload Process Users can upload multiple PDF files. The system extracts text, splits it into chunks, and stores these chunks in a FAISS vector store for efficient retrieval. Ask Answer When a user asks a question, the system uses the vector store to find the most relevant information from the uploaded PDFs. This retrieved context is then fed to the Google Gemini LLM, which generates a comprehensive and informative answer. Key Features MultiPDF Support Process multiple documents simultaneously. ContextAware Provides answers grounded in the specific content of the uploaded files. Gemini Power Leverages the advanced capabilities of the Gemini LLM for highquality responses. Efficient Retrieval FAISS ensures fast and accurate retrieval of relevant information. This project demonstrates the potential of RAG for building intelligent and informative chatbots.
